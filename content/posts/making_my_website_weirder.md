Following the promise of my [previous post](/posts/notes-about-making-the-web-weirder), I changed my website structure, both "behind-the-scenes" and the frontend.

I replaced my [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) setup to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static website generator made in Rust. The main two reasons for this change was the fact that Jekyll has a boring setup (I don't use Ruby for anything else, so it's just extra clutter in my computer), and I couldn't really understand how Jekyll worked - I just followed a recipe to create more blog posts, but I never really felt confortable changing my website to my needs.

Zola, on the other hand, is just a small executable to test locally and build the website (so the setup is much easier), and I can actually understand what is going on much better. This search for a better experience writing content for the website is me scratching the itch to write more, and this is an itch that started to appear more since I've started making [mastonews.com](https://mastonews.com). Little by little contributing to making the internet weirder.
