#### Hi! My name is **Henrique Lacreta Alves**, I'm a Game Developer Engineer, and I (really) like making games.

![Photograph of me handsomly smiling to the camera, side-by-side with the statue of a dinosaur, also handsomly smiling to the camera](/images/dinome.png "Photograph of me handsomly smiling to the camera, side-by-side with the statue of a dinosaur, also handsomly smiling to the camera")

My first experience making games was in 2006 using **Game Maker 6.0**. I haven't stopped since then.

I graduated at **Universidade Estadual de Campinas** in Computer Science, where I was also active member and later Project Director of the student's Game Development group called **Gamux**. I also spent a year at the **Calgary University** in the period of 2015-2016 as part of a scholarship program.

My first steps in professional game development were in 2017, when I started making educational web games at **Clickideia** for schools in underserved regions in Brazil. I worked side-by-side with teachers and pedagogues to create the best learning content for children in elementary and middle school.

I wanted to work in bigger game developing teams, so the second professional step I made was to work in a mobile gaming startup called **Javary Games**. There, I worked with **Godot**, an open-source game engine that I used to teach game development concepts to college freshmen back in **Gamux**.

After publishing two games in **Javary**, I entered **Wildlife Studios**, where I've stayed for 3 years and had the opportunity to work on two flagship games (**Tennis Clash** and **Zooba**) in UI and gameplay squads, and **Sky Warriors** from the very first prototype as the lead engineer to global launch as a full-stack engineer working in every aspect of the game.

I left **Wildlife Studios** to take a sabbatic year, which ended up meaning "I left Wildlife to create a Crypto payment startup to integrate open-source P2P payment rails to indie games" (as one does). The startup ended up not being successful for a variety of reasons, but I learned a lot in the process.

I worked in **GDQuest** for a year, creating high-quality and open-source game demos in Godot to be used in educational content.

I'm currently working on my own projects and looking for opportunities!

My main interests are **Game Design**, **Retro Computing** and **Preaching how good Godot is and that it is MIT licensed! You should totally use
