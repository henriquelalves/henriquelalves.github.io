I (really) like making games. Currently working @GDQuest.

Timeline making stuff professionally:

**2022-2023**:

- @GDQuest: worked on Game Development educational content and existing GDQuest platforms.

**2022**:
- @DogPay: founded a startup to bring crypto closer to Game Development. Didn't work out in the end, but still had a lot of experience developing a Web3 platform, integrating it in games, and creating a business from scratch.

**2019 - 2021**:
- @WildlifeStudios: worked in Sky Warriors, from prototype to Global Launch. Worked on all systems and metagame.
- @WildlifeStudios: worked in the Prototypes Team. Helped finding the fun in unnanounced games.
- @WildlifeStudios: worked in Zooba on the UI team (lots of art integration and UI optimizations on Unity). Refactored the Onboarding system for new players.
- @WildlifeStudios: worked in Tennis clash on the UI and Gameplay teams. Fixed networking shenanigans, integrated the skin assets in the game client.

**2018**:
- @JavaryGames: created mobile casual games with Godot.

**2017-2018**:
