  <p>Too long since my last devlog, and Lisp Game Jam already went by! The game I made was this one: <a href="https://illusion-fisherman.itch.io/life-predictor">Life Predictor</a>. It's not 100% stable (I have a segfault happening sometimes lol, lmao even), but it's a nifty simple Game of Life puzzle.</p>
<p>End result: I managed to finish the game on time, and I have a very clear image of the &quot;feature-complete&quot; engine in my head - but the engine itself is far from finished. The current game was made with Raylib (in C) and S7 Scheme for all gameplay scripts, and a very simple wrapper on some Raylib functions. What I managed to validate:</p>
<ul>
<li>S7 Scheme works QUITE well for what I have in mind. I can easily integrate it in C, its source code is very simple, I have easy access to its garbage collector events, and I can easily compile it to web!</li>
<li>Evaluating code in runtime is quite easy, but there are some small shenanigans I have to be careful when I have pointers to Scheme code in C (e.g. using <code>set!</code> on a symbol that has a pointer in C makes won't change the memory location C has access to, so it will &quot;see&quot; the same data as before).</li>
<li>Raylib was also really, really easy to integrate. I'm not sure I want to stick it till the end because there are some really interesting libs I wanted to test on rendering, UI and physics, so I may want to keep Raylib a bit modular and work on it's integration as time goes on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I validated the basics of my idea of the perfect Game Jam Engine, this are the features that I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>REPL Server! Specifically, I want to be able to connect to the running game via Emacs Geiser. This is a must have for the feature.</li>
<li>Save states for Scheme code. Ideally, I want the game you play to have a similar behavior than a retro-game emulator, with save states you can load anytime to iterate or test on specific parts of the gameloop.</li>
<li>An Emacs mode for the game engine. It seems a bit too fancy, but the idea is to use the REPL Server to communicate with the game in runtime, and to use Emacs as an IDE to get/set values of any variables you see in the game scripts, know which code is different from the runtime environment, add new pieces of code in runtime, etc. Basically a REPL facilitator.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm pretty much sure this will take a lot of time to be done, but my plan is to keep using the engine on other game jams, and keep on iterating on it.</p>
<p>Last but not least, thanks for <a href="https://github.com/gilzoide">Gil Barbosa</a> to help me out discussing the techstack with me and contributing in the project!</p>
