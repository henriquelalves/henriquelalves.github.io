  <h4 id="hi-my-name-is-henrique-lacreta-alves-i-m-a-game-developer-engineer-and-i-really-like-making-games">Hi! My name is <strong>Henrique Lacreta Alves</strong>, I'm a Game Developer Engineer, and I (really) like making games.</h4>
<p><img src="/images/dinome.png" alt="Photograph of me handsomly smiling to the camera, side-by-side with the statue of a dinosaur, also handsomly smiling to the camera" title="Photograph of me handsomly smiling to the camera, side-by-side with the statue of a dinosaur, also handsomly smiling to the camera" /></p>
<p>My first experience making games was in 2006 using <strong>Game Maker 6.0</strong>. I haven't stopped since then.</p>
<p>I graduated at <strong>Universidade Estadual de Campinas</strong> in Computer Science, where I was also active member and later Project Director of the student's Game Development group called <strong>Gamux</strong>. I also spent a year at the <strong>Calgary University</strong> in the period of 2015-2016 as part of a scholarship program.</p>
<p>My first steps in professional game development were in 2017, when I started making educational web games at <strong>Clickideia</strong> for schools in underserved regions in Brazil. I worked side-by-side with teachers and pedagogues to create the best learning content for children in elementary and middle school.</p>
<p>I wanted to work in bigger game developing teams, so the second professional step I made was to work in a mobile gaming startup called <strong>Javary Games</strong>. There, I worked with <strong>Godot</strong>, an open-source game engine that I used to teach game development concepts to college freshmen back in <strong>Gamux</strong>.</p>
<p>After publishing two games in <strong>Javary</strong>, I entered <strong>Wildlife Studios</strong>, where I've stayed for 3 years and had the opportunity to work on two flagship games (<strong>Tennis Clash</strong> and <strong>Zooba</strong>) in UI and gameplay squads, and <strong>Sky Warriors</strong> from the very first prototype as the lead engineer to global launch as a full-stack engineer working in every aspect of the game.</p>
<p>I left <strong>Wildlife Studios</strong> to take a sabbatic year, which ended up meaning &quot;I left Wildlife to create a Crypto payment startup to integrate open-source P2P payment rails to indie games&quot; (as one does). The startup ended up not being successful for a variety of reasons, but I learned a lot in the process.</p>
<p>I worked in <strong>GDQuest</strong> for a year, creating high-quality and open-source game demos in Godot to be used in educational content.</p>
<p>I'm currently working @ Jungle, creating a new FPS mobile experience!</p>
<p>My main interests are <strong>Game Design</strong>, <strong>Retro Computing</strong> and <strong>Preaching how good Godot is and that it is MIT licensed! You should totally use Godot</strong>.</p>
