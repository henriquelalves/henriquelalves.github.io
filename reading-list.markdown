#### Currently Reading

- POPPER, Karl. *The Logic of scientific discovery*
- HODENT, Celia. *The psychology of Video Games*

#### Finished

**2023**:
- KUSHNER, David. *Masters of Doom*

    It reads like a TV series, romaticized but throughly entertaining. It also gives a great glimpse on America's digital entertainment culture, from it's birth until the aftermath of the Columbine shooting.

- SCHELL, Jesse. 2008. *The Art of Game Design: A book of lenses*

	Some chapters aged quite bad, specially in the first half of the book. Besides that, it's a good "Game Design 101" reference (as long as you filter it properly), it covers a lot of ground without going too deep in anything, and give some interesting insights. The ending was really special, too.

**2022**:
- BETT, Sam. *Ask Iwata*

	Satoru Iwata was one of the first names from the gaming industry I memorized when I was a kid, so this book was an emotional and nostalgia ride for me. It was quite a pleasant read, and the book takes a lot of care describing the life of someone I admired so much. It also contains invaluable leadership lessons from one of the most important CEO's of the modern gaming industry.

- LINSPECTOR, Clarice. *Paix√£o segundo GH*

	The first book from Clarice Linspector I've ever read, and I didn't know it was one of the most difficult too. Relatable in a way that is difficult to explain, and almost surreal in its narrative. Although difficult, I enjoyed it.
