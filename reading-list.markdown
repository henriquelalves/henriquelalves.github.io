#### Finished

**2022**:
- BETT, Sam. *Ask Iwata*

	Satoru Iwata was one of the first names from the gaming industry I memorized when I was a kid, so this book was an emotional and nostalgia ride for me. It was quite a pleasant read, and the book takes a lot of care describing the life of someone I admired so much. It also contains invaluable leadership lessons from one of the most important CEO's of modern gaming industry.

- LINSPECTOR, Clarice. *Paix√£o segundo GH*

	The first book from Clarice Linspector I've ever read, and I didn't know it was one of the most difficult too. Relatable in a way that is difficult to explain, but the book uses its negative space to describe common, everyday-life but undescribable feelings. Although difficult, I enjoyed it.
